\begin{abstract}
We present \emph{Mosquito}, a new LCF-style implementation of higher-order logic (`HOL') written in Haskell, a pure functional programming language.
Mosquito requires a kernel design that does not rest on the use of global references, an ML language feature heavily used in existing HOL kernels.
Wiedijk suggested one such design in his work on `Stateless HOL', a stateless revision of the HOL Light kernel.
In one sense, Mosquito is a clean-slate implementation of a Wiedijk-style HOL kernel, able to leverage Haskell's modern language features and rich library ecosystem.

Yet, Mosquito is something more than a mere rehash of existing HOL implementations.
Mosquito is written in an entirely pure, monadic style, shunning any use of exception mechanisms to handle failure, with an emphasis on totality.
The Mosquito kernel is minimalist, arguably implementing a simpler presentation of HOL than HOL Light.
Further, our representation of tactics draws on inspiration from the Matita proof assistant, where working across multiple open goals simultaneously is the norm.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sect.introduction}

Mosquito is a minimalist, stateless, monadically-structured, largely-total, LCF-style implementation of higher-order logic (`HOL') written in Haskell.
We shall spend the next ten pages of this paper unpacking, and thereafter expanding, this sentence.

Since the dawn of computer science as an independent subject in its own right computer scientists have attempted to make use of computers to help prove theorems, either purely mathematical in form, or related to the verification of pieces of software.
Due to decidability issues with the varieties of logics most suitable for use in formalisation, so-called `interactive proof assistants', where human ingenuity is paired with brute-force automation and clever heuristics, are popular.

Of critical concern, when developing an interactive proof assistant, is the question of \emph{trust}.
How can users trust the resulting theorems generated by interactive proof assistants?
How can we ensure that our systems remain consistent, never allowing us to prove \texttt{False}?
Two different approaches are common amongst current implementations of proof assistants:
